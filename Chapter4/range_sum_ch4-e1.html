		# Eloquent JavaScript, Chapter 3: Functions, Exercise 3
		## Recursion
		<code>		
			You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N),
			similar to how you get its length with "s".length. The returned value will be a string
			containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero,
			which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.
			
			Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number 
			that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.
			
			Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a
			second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting
			only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
			
			console.log(countBs("BBC"));
			// → 2
			console.log(countChar("kakkerlak", "k"));
			// → 4
