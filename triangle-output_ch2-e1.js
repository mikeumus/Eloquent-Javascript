It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

var abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);

(function(){ // This is our self envoking closure. We do this to keep the global environment pure. 
	
	// Long obvious answer: 
	var theTriangle = "";
	for(var i = 0; i<7; i++){
		theTriangle = theTriangle += "#";
		console.log(theTriangle);
	}	

	// Eloquent JavaScript official annswer: 
	for (var line = "#"; line.length < 8; line += "#")
	  console.log(line);
